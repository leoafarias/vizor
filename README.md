## Motivation

After working on [Optr](https://github.com/leoafarias/optr) (One Password to Rule App). We neded up with a foundation for a lot of futuristic/cyberpunk UI elements, and want to further add to it, and clean up to have an awesome UI kit for Flutter.

## Next Steps

Bring over the following components from Optr.

- [x] Typing Effect
- [ ] Decoding Effect
- [ ] Frame
- [ ] Button
- [ ] Instruction
- [ ] SoundEffects

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
